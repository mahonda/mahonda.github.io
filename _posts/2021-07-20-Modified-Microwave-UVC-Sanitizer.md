## Abstract

I modified a broken microwave to be used as a user-safe UV-C sanitizing device that is effective against SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease. The use of a microwave ensures that the user will never be exposed to harmful doses of UV-C light by making use of the safety features that are inherent in a microwave. To make this device as safe as possible, it fully operates without the high voltage inverter circuit board and the magnetron. Achieving this required designing an external circuit that mimics the signals sent by the optocoupler circuit in the inverter circuit board to the microwave's microcontroller.
