## Abstract

I designed a bus-powered USB headphone amplifier that is capable of driving over-the-ear headphones. This headphone amplifier is based on two ICs from Texas Instruments: the PCM2706C which is used for the USB interface and the PCM5102A for the high performance external DAC. The process involved component selection, analyzing component datasheets, applying methods of minimizing noise, schematic drawing and PCB design in Altium Designer, along with soldering and troubleshooting.
