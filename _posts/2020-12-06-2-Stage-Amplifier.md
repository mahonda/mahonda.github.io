## Abstract

This project involved using Cadence Virtuoso and MATLAB to size the transistors of an existing architecture that is composed of a folded cascode amplifier, common source amplifier, and a bias circuit to meet the specifications as shown below. The primary goal was to minimize the power disspation of the architecture while still meeting the specifications.
