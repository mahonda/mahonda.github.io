## Abstract

The design challenge of this project is to create an 8-bit adder that is able to achieve a higher performance compared to the ripplecarry adder. As adders are used in a multitude of applications such as microprocessors, graphics related calculations, and even digital signal processing units, faster-performing adders are necessary for applications that demand performance. We implemented the 8-bit carry-lookahead adder by using 4-bit carry-lookahead generator blocks that are responsible for computing the carryout, group propagate, and group generate bits. This architecture also includes the sum block, which computes the sum, propagate, and generate bits based on the inputs and the carry-in. The design process includes hand-designing the schematic, performing partial layout, and ensuring DRC and LVS reports were cleared.
